Anonymous Leaks source

Just download the zip and publish in your public directory of your host :)

This is a lot of manual work for me that I don't have time for so just going to allow everyone to host their own version, that means don't believe any dumps they post unless it's a trusted source because we will no longer have control of the files uploaded to the site.

The best method of posting new dumps is to grab the .torrents available on other leak sites. Just make sure you recognize them as a source on your website! It's respectful.

Good luck. Slava Ukraini!
